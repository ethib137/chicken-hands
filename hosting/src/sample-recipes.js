		description: 'What makes Peruvian-style rotisserie chicken so uncommonly delicious? It’s the spice rub. Not only does it taste amazing, the thick wet rub also creates a sensational crust that seals in juices. The result is a bird that’s incredibly juicy with a super-flavorful crispy crust. If you can’t get to Lima, here’s how to do it at home! It’s so easy.',
